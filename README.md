# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to build an interactive webpage to explore UFO sighting data.  
I used a filtering system to parse the data and display the sightings that fell in to the  
date, state, city, object shape, and country specified in the user input. 

## Results
The [Data](https://github.com/David-P23/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js) yielded the following results:  

The results are displayed in a table and sorted by the five filters mentioned above.

The different filter functions are working, displaying the data correctly and in the right order.

## Summary
This is a great tool for sorting through data, but there are no images or additional info on each  
individual sighting. If further developing this webpage, I recommend adding image search capabilities  
and links to direct users to the original source of the sighting info.
