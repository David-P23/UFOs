# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to build an interactive webpage to explore UFO sighting data.  
I used a filtering system to parse the data and display the sightings that fell in to the  
date, state, city, object shape, and country specified in the user input. The results are  
displayed in a table and sorted by the applicable filters.

## Results
The [Data](https://github.com/David-P23/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js) yielded the following results:
